Accessing Outlook Categories in Delphi
======================================
I'm helping a friend with some Microsoft Outlook integration and came across the need to access the list of meeting and email categories defined within Outlook. Microsoft has done a [great job of documenting the object model for Outlook](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.interop.outlook(v=office.14).aspx), so it's quick work in Delphi to open an OLE connection to Outlook and get a listing of the Categories.

This project is a sample app I created as a proof of concept to see how hard it would be to get the categories. Turns out it's not that hard. Enjoy!
